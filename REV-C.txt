Fix:
	Current sink (set pot needs to go between 2.5V and V-) fixed.
	
	
Change:
	Remove fuse (move to primary side)
	Layout, SMD, (single board with control and display breakout, test points)
	Single sided layout?
	
	Optimize for single quad op-amp
	Increase input impedence of current sense amp
	Increase voltage rating of caps (to support 30V input)
	Change resistor for reference to allow 30V input

Add:	
	Decouple negative rail and between rails
	Output protection (Reverse polarity diode and fuse)
	Add offset control for current sense amp
	Filtercap for negative rail (after regulator)

Test:
	Shunt regulator instead of -5V regulator
	Single MOSFET current sink
