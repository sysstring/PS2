Fix:
	Current sink (set pot needs to go between 2.5V and V-) fixed.
	
	
Change:
	Remove fuse (moved to primary side)
	Layout, SMD, (single board with control and display breakout, test points)
	Single sided layout?
	
	Optimize for single quad op-amp
	Increase input impedence of current sense amp
	Increase voltage rating of caps (to support 25V input)
	From single power resistor to SMD array and adjust diff. amp accordingly
	Supply Vref from 12V rail
	
Add:	
	Decouple negative rail and between rails
	Output protection (Reverse polarity diode and fuse)
	Add offset control for current sense amp
	Filtercap for negative rail (after regulator)
	Local regulator for 555 (12V) and bypass for lower voltage operation

Test:
	Shunt regulator instead of -5V regulator
	Single MOSFET current sink
	Single MOSFET comparator
